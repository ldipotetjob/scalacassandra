package com.ldg.dbmodule.datamanipulation

== this is DM(Data Manipulation) operations package.

== case class ConnectionWithSingleFactorOperation ==> It is case class implement connections for execute Simple statements.
    Its mean NOT BATCH Statement so you with this connection you only can execute single operation, in our case an Insert
    or a Select. If  you implement other operations(Update or Delete) using this pattern you only can execute one of those
    operation at the same time.

    TODO Create BATCH OPERATION ==> You can Fork this repository and add this implementation

==  case class RuntimeDm ==> This
    It is the case class that make the orchestation of all DM operations



== wrappers ==>

    ========Queries=========

    case class SelectWrapper ==> Generic class for all select operations, you pass select statement as a parameter.
                                 Model the Select Operation.


    ========INSERTION=========


    case class InsertWrapper ==> Generic class for all insert operations, you only need and implicit conversion that
                                 let understand your model.
                                 Model the Insert Operation.

    We only can insert in Cassandra tables <Insertable> Objects

    == <Insertable> Objects ==>

    Every <Insertable> Objects must have an implicit conversion that will let convert object in the
    required format needed for the dataStax driver for the insert Command.

The most optimal way to do the INSERT is without checking its status, an inefficient way but that can
be considered although not recommended by apache is to use the IF EXIST clause.

    //insert without check status
    //Resulset.wasApplied always return true
    qb.values(names,values)

    //insert if Not exists de row in other case
    //throw a NoHostAvailableException
    qb.ifNotExists().values(names,values)
    ref. about NOT use this clause:

    TODO UpdateWrapper operation and DeleteWrapper Operations ==> You can Fork this repository and add those implementations
