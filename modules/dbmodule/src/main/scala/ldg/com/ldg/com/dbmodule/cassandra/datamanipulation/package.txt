=====================================================================

ref:
in the below site you can ask for an specific api, in our case we hav ask for datastax api

===========================CONNECTION================================

This module is relate for connection:

ConnConf is an Object that emulate a Singleton. We must create this object when de application
begin and kill it in 2 causes:

- When the application end
- When some error occurs that not let you connect to database


In ConnConf object we add :

  private val config = ConfigFactory.load()

  private val hosts = config.getStringList("cassandra.host").toList
  private val keyspace = config.getString("cassandra.keyspace")
  private val username = config.getString("cassandra.username")
  private val password = config.getString("cassandra.password")

For recommendations of the datastax drivers specifications  we must have more than one contact point.

ConfigFactory is from play and used for read configuration files BUT up to you the way as you add
those credentials.

===============================INSERTION=======================================

The most optimal way to do the INSERT is without checking its status, an inefficient way but that can
be considered although not recommended by apache is to use the IF EXIST clause.

    //insert without check status
    //Resulset.wasApplied always return true
    qb.values(names,values)

    //insert if Not exists de row in other case
    //throw a NoHostAvailableException
    qb.ifNotExists().values(names,values)
    ref. about NOT use this clause:
