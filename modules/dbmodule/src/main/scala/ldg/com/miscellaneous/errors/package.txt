/**

 * Provide the model of error in a functional way
 *
 *  Always deal the exception under this model, except in case of FATAL error in those case
 *  we throw the specific exception and exit of the code.

 *  Kind of errors:
 *
 *  Unexpected error: will down the app
 *
 *  ConnectionError: We can deal with it, no necessarily shutdown de app, we can deal trying to
 *  reconnect data base
 *
 *  ConnException: Any other error Not related with connections eg. when we try to construct some
 *  model. In that case we can try again without kill the cluster and session instance.
